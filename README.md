# DeFi Liquidation Risk Simulator

A theory-driven simulator that stress-tests DeFi lending protocols under collateral price shocks. It combines agent-based liquidation cascade modelling with the equilibrium flash crash framework of Mishricky (2025) to expose a class of risk that standard protocol monitors miss: **a protocol can appear solvent — low bad debt, no cascading failures — while the liquidation market that keeps it solvent is already breaking down.**

## Overview

DeFi lending protocols like Aave let users borrow against crypto collateral. If the collateral price drops far enough, the protocol liquidates the position — a bot repays the debt and seizes the collateral at a discount. The danger is that liquidations can feed on themselves: the selling pressure from seized collateral pushes prices lower, triggering more liquidations, in a self-reinforcing loop that destroyed hundreds of millions of dollars during the May 2021 and November 2022 crashes.

This simulator models exactly that process. It runs on either a **synthetic Aave V3-equivalent pool** (1,000 positions calibrated to real protocol statistics) or a **live position pool** built from current Aave V3 Ethereum reserve data fetched from the public GraphQL endpoint. You choose a price drop, set market conditions, and watch the cascade unfold round by round through an interactive dashboard.

What makes it different from other liquidation simulators is the integration of **F**, the flash crash probability from Mishricky (2025). F measures the per-cycle likelihood that no competitive liquidation quote is posted — that is, the probability that bots refuse to participate because the economics no longer justify it. F is not computed as a post-hoc diagnostic. It feeds back into the cascade itself.

## How the Simulation Works

The simulation begins with a single exogenous collateral price shock — for example, ETH drops 30%. Gas cost and initial stablecoin liquidity are fixed parameters that define the market conditions prevailing at the time of the shock. The cascade then unfolds endogenously from those starting conditions.

After the price shock, any position whose health factor falls below 1.0 becomes liquidatable. The simulator processes these positions round by round. Each liquidation consumes stablecoin liquidity (the bot must repay the borrower's debt) and releases seized collateral. As liquidity drains, the ratio φᵐ = liquidity/debt falls, and the model recalculates F from the new, worse conditions. Gas cost stays constant throughout — it represents the prevailing network conditions at the time of the shock, not a variable that evolves with the cascade. This is deliberate: the gas spike preset models a scenario where network congestion is already elevated *before* the price drop hits, so the liquidation market is impaired from round one.

The key mechanism is the compound participation rate `(1 − F)^1000` across 1,000 quote cycles per round. Only that fraction of liquidatable positions are actually cleared. The remainder stay underwater: bad debt accrues on already-insolvent positions, stablecoin liquidity does not recover, and φᵐ stays depressed — which raises F further in the next round.

The liquidity-driven doom loop looks like this:

```
cascade drains liquidity → φᵐ falls → F rises → bots exit → liquidity drains further
```

But the simulator also exposes a subtler failure channel. When gas is already high at the time of the shock, the posting cost κ is large relative to φᵐΓ from the outset, and the equilibrium tips against bot participation even with ample liquidity:

```
gas spike → κ rises → θ = ln(φᵐΓ/κ) falls → F = e^(−θ) rises → bots exit
    ↓                                                                  ↓
bad debt stays low ← positions remain unliquidated ← no competitive quotes posted
    ↓
risk monitors show "healthy" protocol ← but liquidation market is non-functional
```

This is the scenario that motivates the project. Bad debt is a lagging indicator — it only appears after positions have been liquidated at a loss. F is a leading indicator: it tells you whether the bots that are supposed to perform those liquidations will show up. A protocol can report zero bad debt precisely because its liquidation infrastructure has stopped functioning.

The dashboard's **Bot Participation Model** toggle lets you switch between this endogenous mode and the open-loop baseline (bots always participate) to observe the difference directly. Bot-absent rounds are highlighted in orange on the cascade chart.

## The Conservation Law

The central theoretical result (Mishricky 2025, Footnote 28) ties this together formally:

```
MSE · F = (κ / φᵐ)²
```

The product of price dispersion (MSE) and flash crash probability (F) is pinned to the ratio of posting costs to liquidity. This means MSE and F cannot both be low when κ/φᵐ is large — but they can redistribute between each other. A protocol can exhibit low bad debt and low MSE while F is already elevated, or it can show high bad debt with F still in the STABLE range. The conservation law says both outcomes are consistent with the same underlying fragility; they are just different presentations of the same κ/φᵐ ratio.

The gas spike preset in the simulator reproduces the dangerous case: F enters the ELEVATED RISK range while bad debt remains negligible. Standard risk monitors, which track bad debt and collateral ratios, would not flag the scenario.

## Theoretical Framework

The model implements the equilibrium from Mishricky (2025), which embeds a price posting game among liquidation bots within a monetary economy to derive closed-form expressions for flash crash probability, bid/ask distributions, and price dispersion.

Three DeFi observables map to the theoretical parameters:

| Theoretical Parameter | DeFi Observable |
|---|---|
| κ (quote posting cost) | Gas cost per liquidation, normalised by liquidity depth |
| φᵐ (real value of money) | Stablecoin liquidity depth / total protocol debt |
| Γ (book width) | Daily volatility of collateral asset |

The condition φᵐΓ/κ > 1 is required for any quoting activity. When it fails — because gas is extreme relative to available liquidity — the model correctly triggers market collapse.

**Implemented results:** flash crash probability F = e^(−θ) where θ = ln(φᵐΓ/κ) (Proposition 1); equilibrium bid/ask distributions A(p) and B(p); monotonicity of F in κ and φᵐ (Proposition 11); speculative premium (Proposition 12); and the conservation law MSE · F = (κ/φᵐ)² (Footnote 28).

**Interpreting F:** F is a per-cycle probability. Small values compound rapidly: at 1,000 quote cycles per hour, the daily flash crash probability 1 − (1−F)^24000 reaches ~70% at the STABLE boundary and effectively 100% at the CRITICAL boundary. The thresholds therefore reflect meaningfully distinct risk regimes despite the small absolute values:

| Status | F Threshold | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| STABLE | F < 0.00005 | Competitive liquidation market, low flash crash risk |
| ELEVATED RISK | 0.00005 ≤ F < 0.00050 | Liquidity thinning, market quality degrading |
| CRITICAL | F ≥ 0.00050 | Near-certain daily flash crash, protocol solvency at risk |

## Data Sources

**Live mode** fetches current Aave V3 Ethereum reserve data directly from the public Aave V3 GraphQL endpoint — liquidation thresholds and bonuses, total supply and debt, and available stablecoin liquidity across all active markets. From these parameters, `fetch_live.py` generates 1,000 synthetic positions weighted by each reserve's share of total protocol debt, with health factors drawn from a calibrated log-normal distribution. This means the cascade runs on the actual current distribution of protocol fragility rather than a fixed historical snapshot.

**Synthetic mode** uses an offline pool calibrated to Aave V3 Ethereum statistics as of March 2026 (DeFiLlama, Aave app). If the live endpoint is unreachable, the dashboard falls back to synthetic mode automatically and displays a status message.

## Crisis Scenario Presets

| Preset | Price Drop | Liquidity | Gas | What It Models |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Normal market | 30% | 40% | $80 | Baseline conditions — starts STABLE, deteriorates to ELEVATED RISK as the cascade drains liquidity |
| Liquidity crisis | 30% | 3% | $80 | Capital has fled the protocol before the shock hits; φᵐ is near zero from round one |
| Gas spike | 30% | 40% | $450 | Cost shock — F rises and bots exit even though liquidity is ample and bad debt is minimal |
| Combined shock | 45% | 5% | $400 | Simultaneous liquidity and gas failure; analogue of March 2020 or November 2022 |

## Limitations and Extensions

The conservation law result — that flash crash risk can be elevated even when bad debt is minimal — is reproduced consistently across scenarios. But full quantitative validation of F against empirical liquidation gap frequency requires historical time-series of on-chain liquidation events (March 2020, November 2022) which are not yet integrated. The position pool is also single-asset by construction; real Aave positions are often multi-collateral, which affects both health factor dynamics and the liquidation incentive calculation.

Planned extensions include historical backtesting of F against on-chain liquidation gaps, multi-collateral position modelling (mixed ETH/wBTC/stablecoin collateral), cross-protocol contagion (Aave ↔ Compound ↔ Morpho), and endogenous gas pricing during network congestion.
